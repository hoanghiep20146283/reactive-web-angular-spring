    <b>ShadowDom</b> mode makes use of the browser's native ShadowDom implementation.
    In the high level, concept of it is a restructuring of the final HTML markup
    and CSS for a component that instructs the browser how to isolate the
    component element in a way that its styling and behavior will not bleed over
    into any other element in the document.
