<div>
  <h4>ViewEncapsulation.None</h4>
  <p>
    <b>None</b> mode is used to tell Angular to not do anything special with the
    CSS for components. So no special modular enhancement to the final CSS that
    gets delivered to the browser. All of the CSS you write for a component in
    either the component decorator, metadata, styles property or in a file,
    referenced by the style URL's Property will get added to the global styles
    as is, the exact same way you write it
  </p>
